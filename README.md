# Introduction

Prevent a breach is a GTA DevSecOps initiative with the main objective of teaching and allowing you to contribute your DevSecOps skills through our meetup objectives. The outcome of the app is to teach your not so informed executive that they play a major role in data breaches.

## Contributing

The application is a very simple React/Node [project](https://databreach-checker.herokuapp.com/) right now in its first version. Below is a simple overview of the deployment process and app architecture, ask yourselves the questions below the images and see if you can contribute to the project by creating pull requests or issues.

From a **development perspective**, how can we improve the deployment workflow to make sure our app is deployed with no issues? (i.e think automated tests!)

From an **operations perspective**, how can we improve the current deployment workflow? (i.e think environments!)

From a **security perspective**, how can we improve the security around the deployment workflow? (i.e think of areas that can be at risk to compromise!)

From a **development standpoint**, how can we improve the current application architecture and code? (i.e think architecture and concepts such as DRY)

From an **operations standpoint**, how can we improve the current application from a usage perspective? (i.e think dependency management and containers)

From a **security standpoint**, how can we improve the security around the application? (i.e create a checklist that we can follow)
